<h2>Project Description and Vision Statement</h2>
<p>TeamMate is a management solution for teams, roommates, and classrooms. Our vision is to help people work together more efficiently and remove conflict and confrontation from groups. TeamMate will be a web based solution and mobile app where members of a team can schedule, describe, and be reminded of current and future tasks. Our framework will provide a one-click way for teams to assign certain tasks to specific members and set up persitence and reward systems so that no deadline is ever missed.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>From dividing up chores in a roommate situation to remembering every homework assignment's due date, it's past time that there was a centralized way to keep track of everything you have on your plate. Having reminders pop up on your phone the day before a homework assignment is due or to let you know that it's your turn to clean the dishes this week would be extremely helpful and would remove the last minute panic when you realize you've been a space cadet and forgotten essential tasks.</p>

<h2>Risks and Mitigation</h2>
<p>A major risk for our team is going to be inexperience. No members of our team have experience with mobile apps, and we have limited experience with webapps. Additionally, none of us have worked on large projects together and as such there will be time spent learning about how to best work together. Although there will be a large learning curve, our team has already established weekly times to meet and everyone on the team appreciates planning ahead and completing objectives before deadlines. With these precautions, we believe that we will be able to achieve our vision and demolish every deadline.</p>
